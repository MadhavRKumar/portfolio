# Why start a blog?
I'm starting this blog partly to become a better writer and communicator. I have so many ideas rumbling around in my head. The only way I've found to make them cohesive is to write them down. 

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for all my notes. So I could just use it as a journal and only write to myself. There is absolutely value in personal writing.

I don't want to just write for myself though. I'd like to share my ideas out loud. I left almost all social media[^1] in 2020. It's hard to recreate the feeling of blasting out half baked ideas into tweets without Twitter.[^2] I have no desire to go back, but I do wish to release my thoughts somewhere besides my poor partner's ears.[^3]

Outside of that, I yearn for a return[^4] to personal online spaces as avenues for self-expression. Freedom from the walled garden. Freedom from [enshittification](https://doctorow.medium.com/social-quitting-1ce85b67b456). A decentralized internet built on open standards. 

I aim to put out a post once a week. No restrictions on length or effort. I just want to start the habit and see where it goes from there.

[^1]: Sans LinkedIn since it's essentially required for jobs these days

[^2]: I don't feel the need to call it X since I left before that existed

[^3]: They are so loving and supportive and seem to actually love the deluge of thoughts that pour out of me late at night as they fall asleep

[^4]: I am aware that "return" invokes a prelapsarian ideal that may have never existed. My earliest memories of the internet are from around 2005 in a post Facebook and Amazon world
