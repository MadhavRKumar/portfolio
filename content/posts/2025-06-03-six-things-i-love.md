It's June, so we've hit the halfway mark of 2025. In the spirit of reflection and
review[^1] I'd like to share six things I've experienced this year that I love.

## [WhatWillMakes - How I Built a Mechanical Calculator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0pJST5mL3A)
This video came out in December of 2024, but I only discovered it this year. This 
video was made specifically for me. Will not only creates a mechanical calculator
primarily out of wood, but also offers a historical analysis of the calculator 
itself. He analyzes the socioeconomic conditions that led thinkers like Leibniz
to commission skilled craftspeople to actually build the machine and embeds his own
experiencing designing and building the calculator within that. 

I was absolutely floored after watching this and can not help gushing about it. It's so
cool. This video is truly a breath of fresh air and I think about it all the time.

## [Ethel Cain - Perverts](https://open.spotify.com/album/3kZk3M80kQTJus45lgRKyv)
I was looking through [RYM's](https://rateyourmusic.com) top charts of 2025 earlier
this year and this album kept popping up. I gave it a shot and boy am I glad I 
did. It mixes elements of ambient drone, pop, and noise while exploring the concept
of perversion. I listened to this while I was playing through 
[Citizen Sleeper](https://www.fellowtraveller.games/citizen-sleeper) and I felt 
they connected together beautifully.

## [Battle Brothers](https://battlebrothersgame.com/)
Battle Brothers is an absolutely brutal tactics and role playing game. Think [Mount and Blade](https://www.taleworlds.com/en/Games/MountAndBlade) 
meets [Final Fantasy Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics) 
meets [Darkest Dungeon](https://www.darkestdungeon.com/). 

There's an overworld like Mount and Blade where you can travel between towns, explore, trigger 
events, and get into battles. Recruiting units with certain traits can give you more options in events
which I enjoy. It adds another level of decision making when recruiting.

Battles themselves are turn-based on a hexagonal grid map. Outside of just health,
however, your units also have Resolve which is their ability to resist panic and
fear. Much like Darkest Dungeon, you can lose control units in stressful circumstances.
Units that suffer tramautic experiences can be permanently altered.

I am a glutton for games that make me lose over and over again.[^2] I'm about 100 hours of 
gameplay in and I'm still on easy mode.

## [Masala Apple Turnover](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/caramel-apple-turnovers/)
I went through a phase earlier this year where I kept making a [rough puff a la
Stella Parks.](https://www.seriouseats.com/old-fashioned-flaky-pie-dough-recipe)
We had some apples leftover from so I decided to use the linked recipe to make apple
turnovers! However, my partner generally dislikes the cinnamon apple flavor profile
so I created a masala version using turmeric, cloves, cardamom, cumin, and coriander
instead. It was a hit!

## [Arkady Martine - Teixcalaan Series](https://www.arkadymartine.net/books)
You should read *A Memory Called Empire* and *A Desolation Called Peace*. The first
book set a high bar and the second one managed to fly past it. One of the central
questions in this series is "how wide is the concept of you?" This ranges from 
the Stationers who have generations of memories implanted into their brains to the Teixcalaan
empire which doesn't distinguish between itself and the concept of "the world". I 
won't spoil anything, but *A Desolation Called Peace* extends this even further
by introducing a tertiary entity with it's own concept of "you".

There's too much to talk about these books in a post like this. So really you should
just read it if you're at all interested in speculative fiction.

## [The Rehearsal: Season 2](https://www.hbo.com/the-rehearsal)
If you haven't seen the first season of *The Rehearsal* or any of *Nathan for You*,
I would recommend starting there first.[^3] Season 2 of the *The Rehearsal* feels like
the apotheosis of the character of Nathan Fielder. This show is definitely not for 
everyone.

Season 1 felt like taking *Nathan for You* to the limits of absurdity that HBO 
would fund with a premise founded on extracting entertainment from the participants. 
Season 2, however, starts to point inwards to Nathan. The show blurs the lines between 
sincerity and bit simultaneously blurring the character of Nathan with the actual person himself.

As an aside, as the absurdity of the season progresses, I couldn't help but think 
of *The Rehearsal* as a job creator for artists. They got to use the deep pockets
of HBO to fund hiring all of those actors, building elaborate sets, creating and operating puppets, 
absurd makeup and prosthetics, and even stilt walkers at one point.


[^1] There is maybe something to be said about how our jobs shape the way we view the world. 
It's semi-annual review season for those who participate.
[^2] Dwarf Fortress has taught me that losing is FUN.
[^3] My partner came into the first season of *The Rehearsal* completely unfamiliar
with *Nathan for You*. It was a jarring experience to say the least.
