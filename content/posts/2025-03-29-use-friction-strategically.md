# Common Threads: Use Friction Strategically
This is a part of a series called "Common Threads". 
My goal is to bring together ideas from different sources I interact with and synthesize them into a post as a means of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).
See the [introductory post](https://www.madhavrkumar.com/posts/2025-03-06-common-threads/) for a slightly more in-depth explanation of what this is and why I'm doing it.

## Definition
Outside of the ideal scenarios of physics problems, friction exists.[^1] This is not a good or bad thing, it simply is. Every time we do something, there is some resistance we must overcome. We can use this strategically. Reduce friction for behaviors you want to encourage. Increase friction for those you want to prevent.

## Example
I applied strategic friction to improve my sleep quality and build a consistent schedule. Research indicated I should avoid screen time before bed. I reduced friction for reading in bed and increased friction for using screens.

**Friction Reduced:**
- Keep an [e-reader](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-bw?variant=41202831949894)[^2] by the bed.
- Bulk download books and queue up a "to read" list.[^3]

**Friction Increased:**
- Set bedtime mode on my phone to start 30 minutes before I actually want to go to bed.
- Remove extra chargers from the bedroom.
- Charge my phone overnight in the living room.

Put together, it requires less willpower for me to "be good" and read in bed instead of watching videos or playing games. The result is, on average, I feel better in the mornings.[^4]

[^1]: In other news, we don't live in [a vacuum and cows are not spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow).
[^2]: I use [KOreader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) exclusively. I tried the default reader and found the experience excrutiating. 
[^3]: Get your books from your local (shadow) library.
[^4]: Obviously, this is only one component. Good sleep is multivariate and everyone's needs are different.
